/**
  This mixin is for routes that should only be accessible if the session is
  not authenticated. This is e.g. the case for the login route that should not
  be accessible when the session is already authenticated. Including this mixin
  in a route automatically adds a hook that redirects to the
  [`Configuration.routeIfAlreadyAuthenticated`](#SimpleAuth-Configuration-routeIfAlreadyAuthenticated),
  which defaults to `'index'`.

  ```js
  // app/routes/login.js
  import UnauthenticatedRouteMixin from 'simple-auth/mixins/unauthenticated-route-mixin';

  export default Ember.Route.extend(UnauthenticatedRouteMixin);
  ```

  `UnauthenticatedRouteMixin` performs the redirect in the `beforeModel`
  method. __If `beforeModel` is overridden, ensure that the custom
  implementation calls `this._super(transition)`__.
