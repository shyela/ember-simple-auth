/**
  The base for all authenticators. __This serves as a starting point for
  implementing custom authenticators and must not be used directly.__

  The authenticator authenticates the session. The actual mechanism used to do
  this might e.g. be posting a set of credentials to a server and in exchange
  retrieving an access token, initiating authentication against an external
  provider like Facebook etc. and depends on the specific authenticator. Any
  data that the authenticator receives upon successful authentication and
  resolves with from the
  [`Authenticators.Base#authenticate`](#SimpleAuth-Authenticators-Base-authenticate)
  method is stored in the session and can then be used by the authorizer (see
  [`Authorizers.Base`](#SimpleAuth-Authorizers-Base)).

  The authenticator also decides whether a set of data that was restored from
  the session store (see
  [`Stores.Base`](#SimpleAuth-Stores-Base)) is sufficient for the session to be
  authenticated or not.

  __Custom authenticators have to be registered with Ember's dependency
  injection container__ so that the session can retrieve an instance, e.g.:

  ```js
  import Base from 'simple-auth/authenticators/base';

  var CustomAuthenticator = Base.extend({
    ...
  });

  Ember.Application.initializer({
    name: 'authentication',
    initialize: function(container, application) {
      application.register('authenticator:custom', CustomAuthenticator);
    }
  });
  ```

  ```js
  // app/controllers/login.js
  export default Ember.Controller.extend({
    actions: {
      authenticate: function() {
        this.get('session').authenticate('authenticator:custom');
      }
    }
  });
  ```

    authenticator__. This might happen e.g. because the authenticator refreshes
    it or an event is triggered from an external authentication provider. The
    session automatically catches that event, passes the updated data back to
    the authenticator's
    [SimpleAuth.Authenticators.Base#restore](#SimpleAuth-Authenticators-Base-restore)
    method and handles the result of that invocation accordingly.

    Restores the session from a set of properties. __This method is invoked by
    the session either after the application starts up and session data was

    be re-checked for whether it still constitutes an authenticated session.

    indicates that `data` does not constitute a valid session and will result
    in the session being invalidated.
